Hi! My name is Beatriz!
I am from Madrid but I need to recognize that I am in love with Asturias (if you have never been there, you have to go)
I am a graduate of Business and Law and as you may be thinking, I really heard about data those years. 
Then I started to work in Too Good To Go as a sales operations analyst where I had to learn by myself abou data analysis (and that's when I fell in love with data). After that, I have worked as a people analytics consultant at Deloitte in the Talent Team. I was a great experience but I felt a little bit frsutrated as their work methods where old and I wanted to learn new things. So thats the mai reason I have decided to become an Ironhacker!!
